Setting the Stage

"Let's import some tools: First, I need some librariesâ€” PIL for image editing, time to manage timing, and random to add some spontaneity."

"My Style Preferences: I like the 'Bebas Neue' font for its bold look. I'll make the text a bright yellow on a dark blue background. Each frame of my animation will last for 0.1 seconds."

"Sparkle Time: I'll include some question marks and spaces for a bit of a sparkle effect."

2. Creating a Text Frame

"My create_text_frame Function: Okay, I know how to make a single frame with text. Here's how:
New Canvas: I'll start with a blank image of the given size using my background color.
Fancy Fontwork: I load up the 'Bebas Neue' font and figure out how big the text would be.
Centering is Key: I calculate where to position the text so it'll appear perfectly centered.
Write it Down: Now, I draw the text onto my image using the specified color and font.
All Done: I return this beautifully crafted image frame."
3. Adding Sparkles

"My add_sparkles Function: Here's how I add some pizazz:
Get the Image Ready: I take an image and get its dimensions for placing the sparkles.
Smaller Font: I'll use a slightly smaller version of the font for the sparkles.
Sparkle Time: Let's add 15 sparkles! To do this, I'll:
Random Spot: Pick random coordinates within the image.
Pick a Sparkle: Choose a random question mark or space.
Write It Out: Draw the sparkle character on the image.
Sparkled Up: I return the image, now with extra flair."
4. Building the Animation

"Messages: These are the messages I want to display: 'H.R.'s !', 'Why aren't you hiring me?', and 'LinkedIn : thekartikeyamishra'."

"Let's Animate: Time to get things moving! For each message:

Make Copies: I create 10 identical text frames.
Sparkle It Up: I add sparkles to each of the copies.
Build the GIF: I add all these frames to my frames list."
5. Saving the GIF

"Final Touch: Now, I take the first frame from my frames list and save it all as an animated GIF. I make sure the timing is right and that the animation doesn't loop endlessly."
